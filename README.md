## Contributing

For more information on the project, its goals, and technical details, please review the [Product Requirements Document](./citycoin-prd.md).

PRs are welcome! Please see the [open issues](https://github.com/citycoins/citycoin/issues) and comment if interested, or submit a PR for review.

All code submitted should be thoroughly commented and tested where applicable. Configurable options for the smart contract or the web UI should be listed as constants.

- Website: https://citycoins.co
- App UI Template: deployed at a unique domain per city, e.g. https://minemiamicoin.com ([repo](https://github.com/citycoins/citycoin-ui))
- Smart Contract Template, cloned and deployed with details for each city: [citycoin.clar](./contracts/citycoin.clar)

## Testing

Contracts are tested via [clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet) and javascript.

To test the contract using `clarinet`, first [install the tool](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet#installation) to make it available on your system.

The following commands are used to run the tests:

- `npm run clarinet:prepare`
- `npm run clarinet:test`, `npm test`, `npm run test`
- `npm run clarinet:check`
- `npm run clarinet:console`

A bash script is provided to prepare the tests as part of `clarinet:prepare`, and executes the following steps:

1. copies all contract files from `./contracts` to `./contracts/clarinet`
2. modifies address used in impl-trait by replacing it with a different address. e.g.
`(impl-trait 'SP3FBR2AGK5H9QBDH3EEN6DF8EK8JY7RX8QJ5SVTE.sip-10-ft-standard.ft-trait)`
is converted to:
`(impl-trait 'ST1HTBVD3JG9C05J7HBJTHGR0GGW7KXW28M5JS8QE.sip-10-ft-standard.ft-trait)`
3. appends at the end of file content of test add-on file with the same name, stored in `./contracts/test_addons`

**Note:** `clarinet:test`, `clarinet:check`, and `clarinet:console` automatically execute `clarinet:prepare`.
