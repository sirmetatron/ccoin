## Contributing

PRs are welcome! Please see the [open issues](https://github.com/citycoins/citycoin/issues) and comment if interested, or submit a PR for review.

**Note:** All PRs should be opened against the `develop` branch!

All code submitted should be thoroughly commented and tested where applicable.

## Testing

Contracts are tested via [clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet) using a custom typescript implementation.

To test the contract using `clarinet`, first [install the tool](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet#installation) to make it available on your system.

After installation, the standard clarinet commands can be used against the root directory, e.g. `clarinet console`.

Several commands are also available to help with testing via `npm`:

- to run all tests:
  - `npm test`
  - `npm run test`
- to run individual tests for cities:
  - `npm run test:mia`
  - `npm run test:nyc`
- to run individual tests by type:
  - `npm run test:cities`
  - `npm run test:base`
  - `npm run test:misc`
- to run more specific tests:
  - `npm run test:mia:auth`
  - `npm run test:nyc:core`
  - `npm run test:base:token`
  - `npm run test:misc:tardis`
  - `npm run test:misc:utils`
  - `npm run test:misc:vote`
- to run specific clarinet functions
  - `npm run clarinet:check`
  - `npm run clarinet:codecov`
  - `npm run clarinet:costs`
  - `npm run console`, `npm run clarinet:console`
