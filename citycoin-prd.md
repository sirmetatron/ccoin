## General Information

### Summary

A CityCoin leverages similar properties of the [Proof of Transfer (PoX) consensus mechanism](https://docs.stacks.co/understand-stacks/proof-of-transfer) of the Stacks blockchain, programmed through a smart contract in Clarity. Anyone can mine a CityCoin, program a CityCoin via smart contracts, and even earn BTC from the respective Citycoin's protocol as it gets more usage.

Each CityCoin initially will not have its own blockchain, but rather will exist on the Stacks blockchain as a fungible token adhering to the SIP-010 standard. The [Stacks blockchain](https://stacks.org/stacks-blockchain) is a layer one blockchain that settles on the Bitcoin blockchain, inheriting its security.

A CityCoin will not be premined or have an initial coin offering (ICO), but instead will be fairly mined in competition with anyone who wishes to interact with the smart contract, and following a diminishing issuance schedule similar to that of Bitcoin and Stacks. Mining of the CityCoin will not begin until the [activation threshold](#fair-and-open-launch) is reached.

When miners submit a mining transaction to the smart contract, 30% of the STX spent will be sent to the designated city's wallet which the will control. The remaining 70% of the submitted STX will be distributed to the CityCoin holders who lock ("Stack") their CityCoins in support of the initiative.

### Purpose and Scope

CityCoins is designed to empower communities of stakeholders to support and build for their favorite cities in a permissionless environment. You can also think of CityCoins as a bedrock protocol for an open source city stack. Since CityCoins are programmable they can be used as fuel to build apps specific to each city. Earnings are generated for the city the more the protocol is used.

Starting with the city of Miami, the community plans to fairly launch a CityCoin that can be "mined" by spending Stacks tokens, as well as locked ("Stacked") to generate yield in Stacks tokens, which can further be Stacked to earn BTC.

As miners compete to mint new CityCoins, a portion of the Stacks tokens that miners spend are deposited into a custodied Stacks wallet, and available for the city leaders to take control of at any time.

There are no time restrictions for city leaders to take control of the funds, nor any usage restrictions for city leaders to decide how the funds should be spent.

This enables a global market in which participants, technical and non-technial alike, can show support for a city.

### Market Assessment and Target Demographics

Bitcoin is finding utility on the balance sheet of several corporate treasuries as protection against monetary debasement and inflation, and local officials are looking into use cases for cryptocurrency, generally starting with Bitcoin.

For example, both Mayor Suarez of Miami and Mayor Conger of Jackson Tennessee are openly and publicly exploring Bitcoin mining as well as programs that allow citizens to pay for services in Bitcoin.

One challenge for a city mining Bitcoin to put it on their balance sheet is that it expensive to do and it does not produce additional earnings once the asset is mined. Mining Bitcoin is a competitive market dominated by large players, such that the capital requirement to start mining, the break-even point, and the power consumption are all considerations a city would need to resolve.

The Stacks blockchain is a Layer 1 blockchain connected to Bitcoin, in which miners spend Bitcoin to bid for and win a fixed amount of Stacks tokens. Stackers have the option to lock up Stacks tokens for a specified amount of time, and in turn, receive a portion of the Bitcoin spent by miners proportionate to the amount Stacked. The average APY earnings in Bitcoin at the time of writing this document is 13%. Statistics can be seen on [Stacking.Club](https://stacking.club).

Taking this concept a level further, a new token (a "CityCoin") would be created on the Stacks blockchain, following the SIP-010 fungible token standard, such that CityCoins can be mined and Stacked per the methods stated above except a portion of the miner's bid would be redirected to the city's wallet overseen by a trusted third party custodian.

## Core Functionality

### Mining

The act of mining a CityCoin is defined by someone sending Stacks tokens (STX) to the smart contract created for the city, using the following criteria.

- anyone can participate as a miner by sending Stacks tokens (STX) to the smart contract created for the city
- the Stacks tokens (STX) spent by miners will be distributed:
  - 70% to CityCoin holders who lock up their CityCoins through Stacking
  - 30% to the city's wallet overseen by a trusted third party custodian
  - **Note:** if there are no Stackers locking up their CityCoins, then 100% of the miner bid goes to the city's designated wallet
- for each block in the Stacks blockchain, miners can attempt to mine a fixed amount of the CityCoin
  - the amount of CityCoins rewarded through mining will follow a diminishing [issuance schedule](#issuance-schedule)
- the winning miner for a given Stacks block is selected by a verifiable random function (VRF)
  - the VRF is weighted by the miner's STX bid compared to the total STX bid of other miners in a given Stacks block
  - after a maturity window (100 Stacks blocks, ~16.5hrs), winning miners can claim the CityCoins as a reward at any time from the smart contract
- both the act of mining then claiming a CityCoin are required to increase the total supply of CityCoins
  - unclaimed CityCoins are never minted, and do not affect the total supply

### Stacking

The act of Stacking a CityCoin is defined by someone sending the CityCoins to the smart contract created for the city, using the following criteria.

- anyone can participate as a Stacker by sending CityCoins to the smart contract created for the city
- a "reward cycle" is defined by the number of Stacks blocks the Stacker intends to lock their CityCoins for
  - a reward cycle is set to 2,100 blocks in the contract code (~2 weeks)
  - if desired, Stackers can select to participate in more than one reward cycle, up to 32 reward cycles (~16 months)
- Stackers will select the number of reward cycles to lock up the CityCoins when submitting their transaction to the smart contract
  - while locked, the CityCoins are held by the smart contract until the number of selected reward cycles pass
  - by locking CityCoins, Stackers are eligible to receive a portion of the Stacks tokens (STX) spent by miners
  - the Stacks token (STX) rewards in a given reward cycle are proportionate to how many CityCoins are locked compared to the total locked from all Stackers in the same reward cycle
  - after the locking period, CityCoins are unlocked and Stackers can reclaim their CityCoins from the smart contract
  - after the locking period, if eligible, Stackers can claim their Stacks tokens (STX) rewards

In addition to the functions above, the Stacks token (STX) rewards can be Stacked again on the Stacks blockchain, yielding Bitcoin at ~10% APY.

### Trading and Open Markets

CityCoins is an open source project and any CityCoin can be listed and available for trading on centralized and decentralized exchanges at any time after mining has begun.

### Usability

In consideration of enabling anyone to participate in mining or Stacking CityCoins, the following criteria will be implemented to interface with the smart contract.

**Note:** the average block times for the Stacks blockchain mirror that of the Bitcoin blockchain, at an average of 1 block every 10 minutes

**Mining**

A user interface for mining should be easy to configure, use and understand, such that:

- a miner can submit Stacks tokens (STX) to the contract using the Stacks Web Wallet
- a miner can choose to submit for one or multiple blocks at a given rate
- a miner can see available CityCoin rewards based on their address and claim them
- a miner can see current and historical mining statitistics, their mining activity, and their mining history

**Stacking**

A user interface for Stacking should be easy to configure, use and understand, such that:

- a Stacker can obtain CityCoins through mining or purchasing them through an exchange
- a Stacker can submit CityCoins to the smart contract using the Stacks Web Wallet
- a Stacker can choose the number of reward cycles to participate in
- a Stacker can see the status of their CityCoins based on their address, and claim any that are unlocked from the smart contract
- a Stacker can see the available Stacks token (STX) rewards based on their address, and claim them from the smart contract
- a Stacker can see current and historical stacking statitistics, their stacking activity, and their stacking history

**Statistics**

Additional performance metrics that may be of use to both the user interfaces above and/or a public-facing website are listed below, inspired by [stxmining.club](https://stxmining.club) and [stacking.club](https://stacking.club).

- current Bitcoin block and Stacks block
- current Bitcoin price, Stacks price, and CityCoin price in USD
- total market cap and trade value for the CityCoin
- total value of the city's wallet overseen by a trusted third party custodian
- when the city takes control of the city's wallet and associated funds
- total spent by miners of the CityCoin in a given Stacks block
- number of participating miners of the CityCoin in a given Stacks block
- number of wins for each miner, identified by Stacks address
- total spend for each miner, identified by Stacks address
- average spend for each miner, identified by Stacks address
- current reward cycle, date it started, and date estimated to end
- total value locked by Stackers of the CityCoin in a given reward cycle
- number of participating Stackers of the CityCoin in a given reward cycle
- total rewards and average slot rewards for Stackers in a given reward cycle

### Technical Requirements

**Smart Contract**

- the operations of mining and Stacking will be provided by a set of CityCoin contracts
  - `citycoin-core`: a contract that handles mining functions, Stacking functions, and data storage
  - `citycoin-token`: a contract that contains the token information, adhering to SIP-010
  - `citycoin-vrf`: a contract that reads the on-chain VRF and returns a random value based on block height
  - `citycoin-auth`: a contract that enables multisig-type transactions for sensitive functions
- the `citycoin-vrf` contract will be used for all CityCoins
- the remaining contracts will be created for each CityCoin, and published to mainnet on the Stacks blockchain
- the contracts are programmed using the [Clarity](https://clarity-lang.org) smart contract language

**Integrations**

- application integration with the Stacks blockchain will be provided by the [Stacks.js libraries](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks.js)
- user identity and transaction signing will be provided by the [Stacks Web Wallet](https://hiro.so/wallet/install-web)
- user data will be encrypted and stored in [Gaia](https://docs.stacks.co/build-apps/guides/data-storage)
- Stacks blockchain information will be provided by a [Stacks API Node](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks-blockchain-api)

## Token Economics

### Fair and Open Launch

The launch of a CityCoin will require at 20 unique wallets to signal activation as part of a function in the smart contract, after which a countdown begins and anyone is eligible to mine the CityCoins within a given Stacks block thereafter.

There are no CityCoins issued or distributed prior to the start of mining.

### Issuance Schedule

Miners receive coinbase rewards for mining the CityCoin outlined in the table below. The "halvings" occur at intervals similar to Bitcoin and Stacks, every 210,000 blocks, and there is a 10,000 block bonus reward for early miners.

The issuance schedule does not begin until mining is activated, and once it begins, the current block height of the Stacks blockchain is recorded in the contract. From there, the issuance continues as follows:

| Time Period                   | Reward            | Notes                               |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| First 10,000 Stacks Blocks    | 250,000 CityCoins | approx. 3 months                    |
| Next 200,000 Stacks Blocks    | 100,000 CityCoins | approx. 4 years, minus bonus period |
| Next 210,000 Stacks Blocks    | 50,000 CityCoins  | approx. 4 years                     |
| Next 210,000 Stacks Blocks    | 25,000 CityCoins  | approx. 4 years                     |
| Next 210,000 Stacks Blocks    | 12,500 CityCoins  | approx. 4 years                     |
| Next 210,000 Stacks Blocks    | 6,250 CityCoins   | approx. 4 years                     |
| After 1,050,000 Stacks Blocks | 3,125 CityCoins   | continues indefinitely              |

After the final halving at 1,050,000 Stacks blocks past the Stacks block height recorded at activation, the total supply is estimated to be `42,187,500,000` and will increase indefinitely by `164,062,500` per year.
